          "BackgroundAn Expert Group was constituted by the Prime Minister on 18th August, 2010 in the context of enhancing employment opportunities among youths of Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh to formulate job plan involving public and private sectors. Among the key recommendations of the Expert Group, one was to offer 5000 fresh scholarships per annum to encourage the youth of J&K and Ladakh to pursue higher studies outside the UTs. The proposal arises out of the identified strategy of a human resource development initiative focused on improving skill set through improving access to education﻿ObjectiveTo provide academic fee (tuition and other admissible fee) and maintenance allowance (to bear expenses on account of \thostel & mess fee, cost of books and other incidental charges) to students belonging to J&K and Ladakh who, after \tpassing Class XII or equivalent examination, secure admission in Government colleges/institutions and other select \tinstitutions outside the UTs of J&K and Ladakh through AICTE’s counselling process under the supernumerary quota \tcreated by the Government except in medical courses. Scheme was launched in the year 2011 and modified from time \tto time to make the scheme student friendly. The scheme also envisages to build capacities of the youth of J&K and \tLadakh to enable them to compete with their peers in the national mainstream and exposure to other states and union territories’ culture, language, and livelihood and promote the understanding of ‘Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat.’.﻿SCOPEUnder the scheme 5000 fresh scholarships are available per annum. Out of these, 2070 scholarships are for General \tDegree Courses, 2830 for Professional/Engineering courses and 100 for Medical Courses. The number of scholarships \tfor Engineering and Medical Studies would be kept flexible, subject to the ceiling of 5000 fresh scholarships per annum \tand subject to the savings accruing from any shortfall in the number of students opting for General Degree courses﻿"

The scheme mainly focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at the farm level through Micro Irrigation (Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation System). Besides, it also supports micro-level water storage, and water conservation/management activities (Other Interventions) to supplement source creation for Micro Irrigation.Objectives:Increase the area under micro irrigation technologies to enhance water use efficiency in the country.Increase the productivity of crops and income of farmers through precision water management.Promote micro-irrigation technologies in water-intensive/consuming crops like sugarcane, banana, cotton, etc., and give adequate focus to extend the coverage of field crops under micro-irrigation technologies.Make potential use of micro irrigation systems for promoting fertigation.Promote micro-irrigation technologies in water-scarce, water-stressed, and critical groundwater blocks/districts.Link tube-well / river-lift irrigation projects with micro irrigation technologies for the best use of energy both for lifting and pressurized irrigation as far as possible.Establish convergence and synergy with activities of ongoing programmes and schemes, particularly with created water sources for their potential use, integration of solar energy for pressurized irrigation, etc.Promote, develop, and disseminate micro irrigation technology for agriculture and horticulture development with modern scientific knowledge.Create employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled persons, especially unemployed youth for installation and maintenance of micro irrigation systems.Important Features:Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) not only focuses on creating water sources for assured irrigation, but it also creating protective irrigation by harnessing rainwater at the micro level through ‘Jal Sanchay’ and ‘Jal Sinchan’. Micro irrigation is an integral component of the scheme to maximize water use efficiency at the farm level.There are four components to the scheme: Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP), Per Drop More Crop (PDMC), Har Khet Ko Pani, and Watershed DevelopmentPer Drop More Crop: to focus on micro-level storage structures, efficient water conveyance & application, precision irrigation systems, topping up of input cost beyond MGNREGA permissible limits, secondary storage, water lifting devices, extension activities, coordination & management - being implemented by DAC&FW.Nodal Department:Since the final outcome of PMKSY is to ensure access to efficient delivery and application of water at every farm thereby enhancing agricultural production & productivity, State Agriculture Department may be the Nodal Department for implementation of PMKSY (Per Drop More Crop).

        "Frequently Asked Questions": [
          "Does The Programme Provide Connectivity To Only Revenue Villages? Are Hamlets Eligible To Be Connected?The spirit and objective of PMGSY-I was to provide good all-weather road connectivity to eligible unconnected habitations. The unit of this programme is a habitation and not a revenue village or a Panchayat. A habitation is a cluster of population, living in an area, the location of which does not change over time. Desam, Dhanis, Tolas, Majras, Hamlets, etc. are commonly used to describe habitations.\n\nThe population, as recorded in the Census 2001, shall be the basis for determining the population size of the habitation. The population of all Habitations within a radius of 500 metre (1.5 km of path distance in case of Hills) may be clubbed together to determine the population size. In the blocks bordering international boundary in the hill States (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs), however, all habitations within a path distance of 10 km may be treated as a cluster for this purpose. This cluster approach would enable the provision of connectivity to a number of Habitations, particularly in Hill/ mountainous areas.\n\nA special dispensation has been allowed to Arunachal Pradesh under PMGSY by extending the Cluster approach to all International border districts in the State by clubbing population with the path distance of 10 km and treating as a Cluster.How Are Habitations Selected For Coverage? Who Decides Which Habitations Will Be Covered In A Year?Unconnected habitations are listed as per the priority (generally, habitations with a higher population, as per 2001 Census, would be connected first) and depending upon the funds likely to be made available for the State, the list of road works to be taken up under PMGSY-I will be finalized each year by the District Panchayat through a consultative process involving Panchayati Raj Institutions and elected representatives.Can An Individual Apply For Road Connectivity?The objective of PMGSY-I was to provide road connectivity to unconnected habitations as mentioned in response to Question 1 above. Any proposal for road connectivity may be perceived as per the programme guidelines.How Is Alignment Selected? Are Local Villagers Associated With This Process?A simple, non-formal transect walk shall be organised by the Assistant Engineer at the time of preparation of DPRs to finalise the alignment. The Panchayat Pradhan, local patwari, the JE, Local Revenue and Forest officials, Women PRI members and representatives of Women Self Help Groups (SHGs) also participate in the transect walk to determine the most suitable alignment, sort out the issues of land availability and to moderate any adverse social and environmental impact, eliciting necessary community participation in the programme. After transect walk, the minutes should be placed and approved by the Grama Sabha.Local people including those likely to be affected by proposed alignment are also allowed to put forth their view in this process.What Does All-Weather Connectivity Mean? Does It Mean Only Black- Topped Or Cement Concrete Roads?An all-weather road is one that is negotiable in all seasons of the year. This implies that the road-bed is drained effectively but this does not necessarily imply that it should be paved surface with blacktopping or cement concrete. A gravel road can also be an all-weather road.How Is The Problem Of Drainage Tackled In The Portion Of Roads Passing Through Built-Up Residential Areas?Road portions passing through built-up residential areas are prone to damages caused by wastewater from households. Programme guidelines provide for the construction of cement concrete pavement or cement/stone block pavements along with covered or uncovered Pucca side drains as per site conditions.Is The Adequate Provision For Culverts Or Cross-Drainage Works Made?The objective of the PMGSY is to provide an All-weather Road with necessary culverts and other cross drainage structures, which is operable throughout the year to the eligible unconnected habitations as per PMGSY guidelines in the rural areas. Rural roads constructed under PMGSY must have proper embankment and drainage. Adequate number and type of Cross Drainage (CD) works, including causeways, where appropriate, must be provided based on site requirements ascertained through necessary investigation. Minor bridges can be provided wherever necessary.\n\nA necessary advisory has been already issued to the State Governments to include the culverts/CDs bridges along with the road proposals.\n\nThe proposal of long-span Bridges should be prepared as a separate DPR. However, such proposals of Bridges should be submitted with road proposals in the same batch.What About Bridges On Rivers/Streams?Bridges on rivers/streams crossing the alignment of the road are taken up under the program along with the road proposal. The Ministry issued PMGSY-III guidelines increasing the span of Long-Span Bridges (LSBs) for funding under PMGSY as follows:\n\nUp to 200 m in respect of Special Category States and LWE districts identified by the MHA.\nUpto 150 m in respect of other States.Whether Compensation For Land Acquisition Is Paid In The Program?The rural road is a State subject and it is the responsibility of State Government/ District Panchayat to ensure the availability of land for construction of road works under the programme. In view of the common benefit, generally, the land for construction of roads under PMGSY is made available by the villagers/Panchayat free of cost through voluntary donation. However, in rare cases, if the land is acquired for construction of roads under PMGSY, the State Government is required to pay compensation.How Are Executants Selected For The Construction Of Roads?Executants for construction of roads are selected through open competitive bidding for which well-established procedure for tendering is followed by the State Government. As per provisions, the bidders who have the prescribed qualifications and have the capacity to execute the works are required to take part in the bidding process. To enhance the transparency in tendering and speed up the tendering process, e- procurement of bids has been made mandatory.If Defects Are Noticed After Completion Of The Road, How Are They Rectified?As per provisions of the contract, the contractor is liable for any defect that may occur until 5 years after completion of the road work. To enforce liability of defects, the security amount is deducted from the bills of the contractors. The contractor has to rectify the defect in the above period and if the rectification has not been carried out, the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) is required to rectify the defect and recover the cost from the security deposit of the contractor.How Is The Quality Of Work Checked And Monitored?Every contractor is required to establish a field laboratory in every package of road works in which he/she required to test the quality of material and workmanship under the supervision of executing agency. In addition to checking of quality by departmental officers of executing agency, the State Government is required to deploy independent monitors for monitoring of the quality of road works. Independent National Quality Monitors (NQMs) are also deployed by the Central Government for monitoring the quality of works randomly.Is There A Provision For The Display Of Project-Related Information At Project Sites?Citizen Information Board in the local language containing the following detailed information of work is provided on each work:-\n\nDescription of every layer of work.\nDescription of the quantity of material involved in work.\nHow the road will be built and description.\nGeneral information board containing information about executing agency, contractor, estimated cost of work and time for completion is also provided on every worksite.What Is The Role Of Public Representatives In Checking The Quality Of Implementation Of The Programme?In the interest of total transparency and to ensure the pro-active role of public representatives, the States have been advised to organize a time-bound inspection of road works with local public representatives in the following manner:-\n\nThe Superintending Engineer would request the Hon’ble M.P. and Zila Pramukh once in 6 months duration to select road works in respective areas and joint inspection/visit would be organized.\nThe Executive Engineer would request the Hon’ble MLA and Chairperson of Intermediate Panchayat once in three months duration to select road works in respective areas and joint inspection/visit would be organized.\nThe Assistant Engineer would request the Sarpanch once in two months duration to select road works in respective areas and joint inspection/visit would be organized.Whether Information About The Programme Is Available On Any Website?Yes, information about the programme and details about every work is available on programme website www.omms.nic.in and www.pmgsy.nic.in.The Online Monitoring and Management System (OMMS) is being used for effective management and monitoring under the programme. The required data is entered by the field level staff and the State units under this web-based package.How Are The Roads Maintained?Along with the tendering for the construction the routine maintenance of road works for five years after completion of work is also included. Programme guidelines envisage a transfer of road works for maintenance to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) after 5 years upon completion of the road work.What Should Be The Population Of Habitations To Be Covered Under PMGSY-I For Providing Connectivity?The programme envisages connecting all eligible unconnected habitations by way of an all-weather road as per Core Network with a population of 500 persons (as per 2001 Census) and above in plain areas and 250 persons and above (as per 2001 Census) in the Special Category States (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, and Uttarakhand), Tribal (Schedule-V) areas, the Desert Areas (as identified in Desert Development Programme) and in Selected Tribal and Backward Districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs/Planning Commission). In the critical 267 Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected blocks (as identified by MHA), additional relaxation has been given to connect habitations with population 100 persons and above (2001 census)."

          "The universe of eligible beneficiaries under PMAY-G will include all the houseless households living in zero, one, or two-room houses with kutcha walls and kutcha roofs (as per SECC data, and subject to the exclusion process).Criteria for Automatic/Compulsory Inclusion -1.\tHouseholds without shelter2.\tDestitute/ living on alms3.\tManual scavengers4.\tPrimitive Tribal Groups5.\tLegally released bonded laborerPrioritisation within the Universei.  There will be multilayered prioritization within the universe of eligible PMAY-G beneficiaries. Priority will first be assigned on the basis of parameters reflecting housing deprivation in each category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others.ii.  To begin with, households will be prioritized based on houselessness followed by the number of rooms; zero, one, and two rooms, in that order.iii.  In a particular social category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others, households that are houseless or living in houses with a lower number of rooms shall not be ranked below households living in houses with a higher number of rooms.Within the above priority groups, households that fulfill the criteria of \"compulsory inclusion\", will be further elevated. Automatically included households shall not rank lower than other households within a priority group. Inter-se priority within the two subgroups viz. households which are automatically included and otherwise will be determined based on their cumulative deprivation scores.The scores will be calculated from the socio-economic parameters given below with each having equal weight:i.\tHouseholds with no adult member between ages 16 to 59ii.\tFemale-headed households with no adult male member between ages 16 to 59iii.\tHouseholds with no literate adult above 25 yearsiv.\tHouseholds with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult memberv.\tLandless Households deriving the major part of their income from manual casual laborvi. Households with higher deprivation scores will be ranked higher within the subgroups.Note:To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the selection is objective and verifiable, the housing deprivation parameters in the SECC data will be used for identifying households and then verified by the Gram Sabhas.Earmarking of Targets -For SC/ST:60% of the target allocated to each State/ UT should be earmarked for SC/STs, subject to the availability of eligible beneficiaries. Within earmarked targets, the proportion of SC and ST is to be decided from time to time by the respective States/UTs. Further, the States/ UTs would be allowed to interchange targets between SC and ST if there are no eligible beneficiaries from either of the category and it is certified as such. In case all eligible SC and ST households are covered, the State/ UT targets would be allocated to beneficiaries from the 'Other' categories included in the Permanent Wait List drawn from SECC 2011.For Minorities:Further, as far as possible, 15% of the total fund would be earmarked for Minorities at the National Level for households. The allocation of targets for Minorities among the States/UTs will be on the basis of the proportionate rural population of Minorities in the respective State/UT as per Census 2011 data. Minorities notified under Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992 are to be considered eligible for receiving benefits against Minority earmarks.For PwDs:Accordingly, in the scheme of PMAY-G, while deciding the inter-se priority among the beneficiaries who are to be provided assistance, households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member have been accorded additional deprivation score so that such households are given priority while allotting the houses. Keeping in view the provisions of the Persons with Disabilities Act, of 1995, the States to the extent possible, may ensure that 3% of beneficiaries at the State Level are from among persons with disabilities.Tie BreakerIn case there is a tie with more than one household within a subgroup having the same deprivation score, the households will be ranked according to priority on the basis of the following parameters:i.\tHouseholds with widows and next-of-kin of members of defence/paramilitary/police forces killed in action.ii.\tHouseholds where a member is suffering from leprosy or cancer and People living with HIV (PLHIV).iii.\tHouseholds with a single girl child.iv.\tBeneficiary families of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, commonly known as the Forest Rights Act.v.\tTransgender persons."

        "Frequently Asked Questions": [
          "I'm a tenant farmer without formal land ownership documents. Can I still apply for crop insurance under PMFBY if I can prove I cultivate the land?Yes, tenant farmers and sharecroppers can apply with a valid land tenure agreement. You must provide evidence of your cultivation rights through state-recognized documents or agreements.My crops were damaged by unseasonal rains after harvesting while drying in the field. Does PMFBY cover such losses?Coverage is available for up to 14 days post-harvest for crops kept in \"cut & spread\" condition in the field, specifically for damage from cyclonic/unseasonal rains. You must report the damage immediately.What is the exact premium rate for Kharif paddy, and how is the government subsidy calculated?Farmers pay 2% of the sum insured for Kharif food crops. The difference between the actuarial premium rate and farmer's share is jointly subsidized by Central and State governments equally.If a drought prevents me from sowing crops despite preparation, what percentage of compensation can I claim?You can claim up to 25% of the sum insured under prevented sowing coverage, provided the majority of farmers in your notified area were also prevented from sowing due to adverse conditions.I farm in Himachal Pradesh. Do I need to pay any premium for my apple crop under PMFBY?No, farmers in Himachal Pradesh, along with other North-Eastern states and Jammu & Kashmir, receive 100% premium subsidy from the government for all notified crops.Can I claim compensation if my entire village faced crop damage from a landslide, but neighboring villages were unaffected?Yes, PMFBY covers localized calamities like landslides on an individual farm basis, even if the damage is isolated to specific areas within the notified region.How long after reporting crop damage should I expect to receive the claim amount?PMFBY aims to process and settle claims within two months of harvest, provided all documentation is complete and damage assessment is finalized.If I've taken a bank loan for farming, do I need to separately apply for PMFBY, or is it automatic?For loanee farmers, coverage is compulsory but not automatic. You must ensure your bank has processed your PMFBY enrollment within the specified timeframe.What happens if I'm unable to pay the premium online due to technical issues on the last date?You can visit a nearby CSC or bank branch to submit your premium payment. Keep proof of your online payment attempt for any deadline-related disputes.If I've already registered on the PMFBY portal last season, do I need to create a new registration for this season?No, use your existing registration. However, you must submit a fresh application and premium payment for each season you want coverage.I discovered pest damage in my field but couldn't document it immediately due to hospitalization. Will my claim be rejected?Report the damage as soon as possible with medical documentation of your hospitalization. Each case is evaluated based on provided evidence and circumstances.How can I ensure my claim isn't rejected due to wrong information if the CSC operator fills my form?Always verify the entered details before final submission. Request a printed copy of your application form and keep the acknowledgment receipt with the application number.If my crop loss assessment shows 60% damage but I'm not satisfied with the evaluation, what's the grievance process?File an appeal through the PMFBY portal or submit a written complaint to your district agriculture officer within 7 days of assessment. Include evidence supporting your claim.Does PMFBY cover damage from wild animals or fire caused by neighboring fields?Natural fire is covered, but damage from wild animals isn't. For fire spreading from neighboring fields, you must provide evidence that it wasn't due to negligence."

In addition, employees do face difficulties in doing their official work in Hindi as they are less acquainted or non-acquainted with Hindi terminologies of these subjects. The Department of Official Language is undertaking this scheme with the sole objective to encourage writing books in Hindi on the above-mentioned subjects.(B) Various Ministries/Departments have undertaken different award schemes related to Hindi at the national level.

          "Started in the year 1997-1998 (and amended in the year 2004-2005), Udyogini is an innovative scheme sanctioned by the Government of Karnataka to assist women in gaining self-reliance and economic independence through self-employment, mainly through trade and the service sector. It also provides for a subsidy on loans from the Karnataka State Women’s Development Corporations for undertaking business activities/ micro enterprises through banks and other financial institutions. Loans are disbursed through financial institutions like commercial banks, district cooperative banks, and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs).﻿In absence of a structured credit system, women would take loans from private borrowers and end up paying a high rate of interest. Hence, there was felt a need to have in place formal channels of credit which are accessible to women. Profitable business activities are approved and supported under this scheme. They may be bookbinding and notebooks manufacturing, chalk and crayon manufacture, jam, jelly, pickles manufacture, papad manufacture, saree, and embroidery work, printing and dyeing of clothes, and woolen weaving, amongst others. Udyogini gives adequate opportunities to such women to help them be self-employed."

This species is considered to be major source of economic sustenance for these categories of people. Adaptability of goats to wide range of agro climatic conditions has rendered it suitable for poor farmers. Under this scheme it has been proposed to distribute units of 11 goats (10 females +1male), 5 goats (4 females +1 male) and 3 goats (2 females +1 male) of Beetal/Sirohi/Jamanapari/White Himalayan breeds on 60% subsidy.Objectives of this scheme:Increase Income Generation:The scheme aims to enhance income generation opportunities for economically weaker sections through goat farming.Boost Meat Production:By providing high-quality goat breeds, the scheme aims to increase meat production in the state.Support Economically Disadvantaged Families:The scheme offers a 60% subsidy on goat units, making it easier for financially weaker families to start goat farming.Promote Rural Development:Encouraging goat farming contributes to the overall development of rural areas in Himachal Pradesh.Ensure Sustainable Livelihoods:The scheme provides a sustainable livelihood to small farmers and landless laborers, reducing their economic vulnerability.",

Many students from this section who find it hard to bear the full tuition fee will benefit immensely from the Scheme.﻿The Scheme is to extend financial assistance to the meritorious and needy students pursuing higher education in the NCT of Delhi. Under this Scheme the Delhi Higher Education Trust through the Directorate of Higher Education (DHE), GNCTD will fully or partially reimburse the tuition fee paid by the students.The extent of reimbursement will be(i)100% tuition fee of the meritorious students belonging to economically weaker section i.e. wards of parent/s who are beneficiaries and possess relevant cards issued under the National Food Security Security Scheme.(ii) 50%of the tuition fee to meritorious students having annual family income up to Rs.2.50 Lakh and not covered under the National Food Security Scheme.(iii) 25% reimbursement of tuition fee to meritorious students having annual income above Rs.2.50 Lakh but below Rs.6 Lakh.
